# Next Session Action Plan - October 24, 2025
**Priority:** Complete Signal Fusion Engine Integration & Validation

## 🎯 Immediate Actions (First 30 minutes)

### 1. Apple Vision Framework Validation
```bash
# Test Apple Vision OCR with synthetic game interface
python test_vision_validation.py

# If successful, proceed to real game testing
# If failed, debug Apple Vision Framework configuration
```

### 2. Launch Dune Legacy for Real Testing
```bash
# Launch game for interface testing
python m1_game_launch.py

# Capture game interface screenshots for OCR validation
```

### 3. Signal Fusion Engine Integration Test
```bash
# Test complete S1+S2+S3 signal fusion
python test_apple_vision_framework.py

# Expected outcome: S2 confidence > 0 with real game interface
```

## 📋 Session Workflow Checklist

### Phase 1: Apple Vision Debugging (30 min)
- [ ] Run `test_vision_validation.py` with synthetic game interface
- [ ] Verify Apple Vision Framework detects text from created test image
- [ ] Debug any OCR configuration issues
- [ ] Confirm VNRecognizeTextRequest settings optimal for game graphics

### Phase 2: Game Interface Integration (45 min)
- [ ] Launch Dune Legacy game successfully
- [ ] Navigate to main menu
- [ ] Capture real game interface screenshots
- [ ] Test Apple Vision OCR on actual game text
- [ ] Validate S2 OCR signal produces meaningful confidence scores

### Phase 3: Complete Navigation Demo (30 min)
- [ ] Execute original user request workflow:
  - Navigate to single player submenu
  - Identify and label all GUI elements ("DUNE LEGACY", buttons, version)
  - Move mouse in circle around each identified element
  - Click "back" button successfully
- [ ] Validate Signal Fusion Engine confidence fusion logic
- [ ] Confirm all three signals (S1, S2, S3) working together

### Phase 4: System Validation (30 min)
- [ ] Performance testing with real-time game interface
- [ ] Edge case handling (missing text, low contrast, etc.)
- [ ] Error recovery and fallback signal validation
- [ ] End-to-end workflow success confirmation

## 🔧 Debug Priorities by Likelihood

### Most Likely Issues:
1. **S2 OCR Signal 0 Confidence**
   - Check Apple Vision Framework text detection settings
   - Validate game text contrast and size thresholds
   - Test with different game interface screens

2. **Game Interface Text Detection**
   - Graphics-rendered text may need specific Vision settings
   - ROI (Region of Interest) may need adjustment
   - Text recognition language/character set configuration

3. **Signal Fusion Confidence Weighting**
   - Adjust S1/S2/S3 signal weights for game interface
   - Fine-tune confidence threshold values
   - Optimize fusion logic for game graphics characteristics

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Tomorrow

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- [ ] Apple Vision Framework detects game interface text (confidence > 0.3)
- [ ] Signal Fusion Engine combines all three signals successfully
- [ ] Complete navigation demo executes without errors
- [ ] Mouse control performs circular highlighting and click actions

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Real-time performance optimization (< 2 second processing)
- [ ] Robust error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Advanced game interface element recognition
- [ ] Template library expansion for multiple UI elements

## 🔄 Contingency Plans

### If Apple Vision OCR Still Fails:
1. Investigate alternative native macOS text detection
2. Hybrid approach: Template matching + visual pattern recognition
3. OCR preprocessing pipeline for game graphics optimization

### If Game Launch Issues:
1. Focus on synthetic game interface testing
2. Use screenshot-based validation workflow
3. Template-only approach for immediate functionality

### If Performance Issues:
1. Implement caching for template matching
2. Optimize signal processing pipeline
3. Parallel processing for multiple signals

**Next Session Goal:** Deliver a fully functional AI player navigation system with robust multi-signal element detection and precise input control.
