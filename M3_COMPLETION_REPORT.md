## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Current Risks
1. **Model Training Data**: Requires DLAT annotation for production models
   - *Mitigation*: Dummy model functional, DLAT toolkit available from Agent B
   
2. **Performance Scaling**: 15.2 FPS may need optimization for complex scenes
   - *Mitigation*: Intel optimization implemented, batch processing ready
   
3. **Agent Coordination**: Multi-agent workflow needs continued synchronization
   - *Mitigation*: Protocol V1.3 established, Git workflow active

### Mitigated Risks
- ✅ **Architecture Scalability**: Learning-based system replaces rigid rule-based approach
- ✅ **Platform Compatibility**: Intel CPU optimization removes hardware dependencies  
- ✅ **Integration Complexity**: Modular design enables independent component testing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Begin M4 Implementation**: State vector conversion from SemanticMap
2. **DLAT Training Data**: Coordinate with Agent B for annotation toolkit usage
3. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize for 30+ FPS target

### Strategic Priorities  
1. **Production Model Training**: Leverage Agent B's DLAT for custom YOLOv8 models
2. **RL Integration Planning**: Design state/action spaces for PPO training
3. **Continuous Integration**: Establish automated testing pipeline

## Conclusion
